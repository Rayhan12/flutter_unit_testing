# Welcome to unit testing in flutter  

> Lets first learn the about 2 core concepts of all testing

**🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Cycle**

1. 🔴 **Red** – Write a failing test.
2. 🟢 **Green** – Write the minimum code to make it pass.
3. 🛠️ **Refactor** – Clean up the code while keeping tests green.

**🧪 Arrange–Act–Assert (AAA) Pattern**

1. 📦 **Arrange** – Set up the test data and environment.
2. 🚀 **Act** – Execute the function or behavior under test.
3. ✅ **Assert** – Verify the outcome matches expectations.
